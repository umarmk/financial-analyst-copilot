\## Scenario



You're investigating RavenStack, a stealth-mode SaaS startup delivering AI-driven team tools. The product was secretly piloted with coding bootcamp graduates, and every sign-up, feature use, support ticket, and churn was captured. Now, you're tasked with discovering what drove conversions, support load, and churn patterns before their public launch.

\## How This Dataset Was Generated



\- Scripted in Python using pandas, numpy, and uuid

\- Temporal logic: Validated date ranges (e.g., signup ≤ subscription ≤ churn)

\- Statistical realism: Exponential and Poisson distributions for seats, usage, and durations

\- Primary \& foreign keys: All tables link properly; no orphans

\- Edge cases: Mid-cycle plan changes, null fields, reactivations, duplicate referrals, beta feature spikes

\- Nulls included: Satisfaction scores, feature usage, churn feedback

\- Fully synthetic: All names, domains, feedback, and data are generated
